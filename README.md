# Robot Stream

## Open DOCUMENTATION.txt for documentation.

The documentation was at first only written for people to maintain my already set-up solution. I tried to rewrite it now, so it can be entirely setup without my help.
Unfortunately, I don't have any Raspberry Pis myself so I could not test my inital setup guide. It's only based on recalling what I did almost a year ago and thus might require some troubleshooting of your own.

Also these files originally were on a flashdrive which was plugged in the school computer to run the webserver, but you could just clone the GitHub repo instead to get it there.
